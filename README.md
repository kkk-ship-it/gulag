 **pdqsort : Pattern-defeating quicksort (pdqsort) is a novel sorting algorithm that combines the fast average case of randomized quicksort with the fast worst case of heapsort, while achieving linear time on inputs with certain patterns. pdqsort is an extension and improvement of David Mussers introsort. All code is available for free under the zlib license.**

**usage**
* supposed to be a drop-in replacement for `<std::sort>`, use call 'pdqsort' instead of std::sort
* if the comparison funtion is brachless call '
